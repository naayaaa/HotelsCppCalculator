Only the List View on desktop version of the website works. The script shows cpp value before the points value, the script automatically refreshes upon changes in the page, but you can also click the "Refresh Calculations" buttom at the bottom of the page to force refresh, you may also click the "Remove Mediocre Hotels" buttom to remove any Hotels with a crappy CPP value.
